                  Here is a simple, flexible framework for reflecting on
                  Scripture as individuals and also within study groups.
                </p>
                <p>
                  •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Begin by offering a prayer
                  acknowledging God’s Presence and asking for His guidance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then read the passage you have
                  chosen a couple of times slowly, asking:
                </p>
                <p>~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the topic of this passage?</p>
                <p>~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is being said about this topic?</p>
                <p>
                  •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, go through the passage again
                  with the questions below in mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jotting down your thoughts will help you
                  concentrate and will provide seed thoughts for reflection.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you also include your prayers of
                  adoration, thanksgiving, confession, intercession, etc., that
                  arise from the passage then your notes will be something of a
                  journal as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These questions can be answered for
                  ourselves as individuals or in terms of our communities,
                  including our church, family, town and/or world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are designed to weave together our
                  own very personal listening to the text with what we learn
                  through study.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These questions are interrelated. For
                  example, a passage may recount an action of God (ques. 3) that
                  reveals something about His character (ques. 4), giving us
                  something to believe about Him (ques. 2) that offers us
                  comfort and/or challenge (ques. 1).
                </p>
                <p><strong>The First Set of Questions</strong></p>
                <p>
                  1.&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp; How does this passage offer comfort?
                </p>
                <p>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B.&nbsp; How does this passage
                  challenge?
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first setof questions starts with our own gut-level
                  reactions. This is a very good place to start, though we must
                  recognize that our answers may come more from our own
                  experience than from what the text itself is trying to say.
                  These questions help us bring the text into contact with our
                  own lives and not merely play intellectual games. Other
                  questions, on the other hand, will help us avoid merely
                  hearing our own voice in the Bible rather than God’s.<strong

                </p>
                <p><strong>The Second Set of Questions</strong></p>
                <p>
                  2.&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp; How does this passage encourage faith?
                </p>
                <p>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B.&nbsp; How does this passage
                  encourage hope?
                </p>
                <p>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.&nbsp; How does this passage
                  encourage love?
                </p>
                <p>
                  This second setof questions focuses on the three “principal
                  virtues,” faith, hope and love. St. Paul says these three are
                  eternal (1 Cor. 13:13) — they are what we <em>can</em> “take
                  with us.” It makes sense, therefore, to build these qualities
                  into our lives as much as possible. The way to do so is by
                  focusing on God, revealed in Scripture and in our lives. So in
                  this section we are not just looking at these virtues as such,
                  but using them as filters for reflecting on our response to
                  the God revealed in the Scripture passage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These questions are more specific than the first set. They
                  help us focus on the content of the passage while continuing
                  to bring the text into direct contact with our lives. Each of
                  these terms refers to two distinct ideas:
                </p>
                <p>
                  •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Faith</em> — Faith here refers
                  to trust and belief.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does this passage give us something to
                  trust God for?
                </p>
                <p>
                  ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does it give us reason for trusting God?
                </p>
                <p>
                  ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does it give us some truth to believe?
                </p>
                <p>
                  •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Hope</em> &nbsp;— Hope here
                  refers to future expectations and to expectation of help now.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the passage give us something to look
                  forward to?
                </p>
                <p>
                  ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does it offer us encouragement in the
                  midst of difficulty?
                </p>
                <p>
                  •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Love</em> &nbsp;— Love here
                  refers to heartfelt concern and to sacrificial self-denial.
                </p>
                <p>~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this passage do we see God’s love?</p>
                <p>
                  ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do we see examples of people loving one
                  another?
                </p>
                <p>
                  ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the passage stimulate devotion to God
                  and care for people, helping us lay down our lives for God and
                  for one another through sacrifice and self-denial?<strong

                <p><strong>The Third Question</strong></p>
                <p>
                  3.&nbsp;&nbsp; What details in this passage seem especially
                  important for understanding its message?
                </p>
                <p>
                  •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the key words in this
                  passage?
                </p>
                <p>
                  ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which
                  words are repeated, point to the main topic, or are unclear?
                </p>
                <p>
                  •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the flow of thought through
                  the passage?
                </p>
                <p>
                  ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How
                  does the thought of the passage develop sentence by sentence?
                </p>
                <p>
                  •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How is the passage itself related to
                  what comes before and after it in its book?
                </p>
                <p>
                  ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the passage part of a larger discussion
                  in its context, or does it start a new thought or event?
                </p>
                <p>
                  •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are there historical or cultural
                  details that are important in this passage?
                </p>
                <p>
                  ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are there names of people, places, events,
                  institutions, customs, or practices that are especially
                  significant or puzzling?
                </p>
                <p>
                  •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are there other places in Scripture
                  that help interpret this passage, or help fill out our
                  understanding of its themes and details?
                </p>
                <p>
                  ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are the key words in this passage used
                  elsewhere in the Bible, providing help in understanding them?
                </p>
                <p>
                  ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are the key topics developed elsewhere in
                  a way that adds insight?
                </p>
                <p>
                  ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are there passages that modify or limit
                  what this passage is saying, showing us that the topic is more
                  complex than what is said in this one passage?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Reference works like a good study Bible are helpful at this
                  point, providing notes and cross references for solid study,
                  so our understanding is well-grounded.
                </p>
                <p><strong>The Fourth Question</strong></p>
                <p>
                  4.&nbsp;&nbsp; What does this passage reveal of God’s
                  delightful beauty.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This question focuses on God Himself, whom to know is eternal
                  life (John 17:3).
                </p>
                <p>
                  •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is taught about the Father, the
                  Son and/or the Holy Spirit?
                </p>
                <p>
                  •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do we learn of God’s character?
                  His heart, i.e., what He loves and hates?
                </p>
                <p>
                  •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do we learn about His ways of
                  dealing with us?
                </p>
                <p>
                  This question is the most significant of all, though the
                  answers may be only a list of attributes. Scripture reveals
                  God and His ways to us. The Bible is a glorious means to a yet
                  more glorious end, the personal knowledge of God Himself
                  through union with the Father in the Son through the Holy
                  Spirit within the covenant People of God.<strong

                </p>
                <p><strong>The Big Themes of Scripture</strong></p>
                <p>
                  These four study questions help us keep in mind the three
                  major themes in Scripture when we are reading any part of the
                  Bible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Person</strong> of God
                </p>
                <p>
                  ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything in the Bible flows from who God
                  is and what He is like.
                </p>
                <p>
                  •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Plan</strong> of God
                </p>
                <p>
                  ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God’s plan is unfolding from Creation to
                  New Creation by way of Redemption.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each part of Scripture needs to be
                  understood in relation to where it comes in the Story, noting
                  especially both the changes that take place as the drama of
                  redemption progresses from stage to stage and what remains
                  constant throughout the Story.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each part of Scripture needs to be
                  understood in relation to how it relates to the ultimate
                  revelation in Jesus and the central events of the Incarnation,
                  Crucifixion, Resurrection, Ascension, and outpouring of the
                  Holy Spirit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Pattern</strong> of Life
                  in Keeping with God and His Plan
                </p>
                <p>
                  ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a way of life that is in sync
                  with God and His will. This way of life is a major part of
                  what it means to share in God’s life in Christ.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pattern of the life of discipleship is
                  an expression in human life of the character of God and His
                  work of redemption as His plan unfolds.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Application to Prayer and Life</strong></p>
                <p>
                  Reflection and study should be done prayerfully, and lead
                  naturally into prayer by revealing God for adoration, His
                  blessings for thanksgiving, and our sin for confession. All of
                  this will also guide our prayer for ourselves and our
                  intercession for others.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Reflection and study must also have an impact on our attitudes
                  and actions, guiding our daily life by showing us through
                  prayer and the Spirit things to do and to leave undone.
                  Usually this will be a reminder of common features of
                  Christian discipleship.

                  At times we will find things that are unclear or
                  controversial. The most important general guideline is that
                  any specific part of Scripture must make sense in the light of
                  Christ and the whole of Scripture interpreted through Christ.
                  The input of the covenant People throughout history is also
                  significant. Trust and obedience to what <em>is</em> clear
                  should be our primary concern as we continue to study and pray
                  over areas of uncertainty.
