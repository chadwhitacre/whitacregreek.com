                  It is a great pleasure to contribute a brief study to this
                  issue of the <em>Journal</em> dedicated to honoring Bishop
                  John Rodgers.&nbsp; John has been a wonderful friend and
                  mentor to me since I came onto the Trinity faculty in 1983,
                  and my family and I deeply treasure our relationship with John
                  and Blanche.&nbsp; Since John’s field of expertise is theology
                  it seemed appropriate to offer some thoughts on the theology
                  of St. John as found in his first epistle.&nbsp; The apostle
                  wrote this document in the midst of great turmoil in the
                  church over new forms of theology that threatened the very
                  life of the church.&nbsp; These new teachings looked very good
                  and were attractive to many in John’s communities, but in fact
                  they represented a form of theology and discipleship that was
                  no longer Christian.&nbsp; So John concludes his letter with
                  the admonition, “Little children, keep yourselves from idols”
                  (1 John 5:21).<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>

                <p>The Purpose of 1 John</p>
                <p>
                  In order to appreciate the profundity of John’s theology we
                  must begin with a very brief description of what is going on
                  behind 1 John, starting earlier with the Gospel.&nbsp; In the
                  Gospel of John we see the reflection of the conflict between
                  the Jewish authorities and Jesus and His followers.&nbsp; The
                  Gospel seems to come from the point at which there is a split
                  into two religions.&nbsp; The key issue in the Gospel is the
                  identity of Jesus as the Son of God and the identity of the
                  Christians as the true children of God, over against the
                  Jewish claims to be such, and their rejection of Jesus and his
                  followers.<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                  1 John seems to come from a later time, reflecting the fact
                  that a split has taken place in the community (2:19).&nbsp;
                  What was this split about?&nbsp; From the evidence in 1 John
                  it appears there was a sizable group within the community who
                  had embraced Gnostic-like ideas.&nbsp; The Gnostics were a
                  mixed group who generally held to a dualistic distinction
                  between the material and spiritual, salvation by
                  illumination/knowledge, and the presence of the divine spark
                  within folk, at least the elect.&nbsp; The major forms of
                  Gnosticism emerged in the second century, but a number of such
                  Gnostic beliefs were already present in earlier philosophical
                  and religious systems, and they were congealing in the second
                  half of the first century.<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                  John himself found some gnostic themes and language very
                  helpful for expressing the gospel.&nbsp; Indeed, some of the
                  language of the Gospel of John would be pure Gnosticism if
                  taken out of context, for example Jesus’ statement, “You are
                  from below; I am from above.&nbsp; You are of this world; I am
                  not of this world” (John 8:23).&nbsp; It is striking that the
                  earliest commentary we have on any part of the New Testament
                  is a Gnostic commentary on John by Heracleon.<a href="#_ftn4"
                    >[4]</a
                  >
                </p>
                <p>
                  While the Gnostic systems of the second century are quite
                  unchristian,<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> there is an important
                  sense in which Christianity itself is a gnosticism, as is any
                  religion that claims to have a revelation.&nbsp; St. Paul
                  refers to “what is falsely called knowledge” (1 Tim 6:20) in
                  contrast to the real, true knowledge of the gospel.&nbsp;
                  Clement of Alexandria (ca. 150-215), writing in the context of
                  conflict with full-blown Gnosticism, calls mature Christians
                  the true “gnostics” (γνωστικοί, <em>gnōstikoi</em>, for
                  example, <em>Miscellanies</em> 6–7).&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is important not to avoid important aspects of the gospel
                  just because other religious systems contain similar elements,
                  as we see today in the New Age movements.&nbsp; But at the
                  same time the use of these themes must be done carefully or
                  else people simply read into the gospel the content of the
                  false system.&nbsp; Something like this seems to have happened
                  in John’s community.&nbsp; John himself drew out the gnostic
                  aspects of the gospel within an orthodox understanding, but
                  some in his community took this tradition and moved toward
                  actual Gnosticism (or, more accurately as far as we can tell
                  at this point, proto-Gnosticism).&nbsp; Specifically, some
                  embraced the notions that Jesus was not the Christ, pure and
                  simple, that there was no need for a sacrificial atonement for
                  sin, and that there was a group of elite within the community
                  who were characterized by autonomous individualism.<a

                <p>
                  John has confronted this teaching to the point that these
                  teachers and their followers have left the community
                  (2:19).&nbsp; What lies behind 1 John is a break in fellowship
                  in a group that had been very tight-knit, having suffered
                  persecution together.&nbsp; So there is extreme pain behind
                  this document.&nbsp; But there is also a clear sense that the
                  very heart of the gospel is at stake in the controversy that
                  has arisen with the false teaching.&nbsp; 1 John was written
                  to combat the false teaching and to give an orthodox reading
                  of the Johannine tradition.&nbsp; At the same time he also
                  assures his readers that they are the true children of God
                  (for example, 1 John 5:13, 21).

                  pattern is more organic than sequential.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
                  this outline is very helpful for seeing the major themes and
                  the cyclical pattern of the material.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>Christology and Ethics in 1 John</p>
                <p>
                  As the outline suggests, christology and ethics are two of the
                  major themes in 1 John.&nbsp; The opponents deny Jesus is the
                  Christ, which for John includes the notion of His being the
                  Son of God.&nbsp; “Son” is the key term for John.&nbsp; As in
                  the Gospel it signifies primarily that Jesus is the revealer
                  of the Father, from whom He is distinguishable but inseparable
                  (John 10:30; 1 John 2:23).&nbsp; The specific features of the
                  opponents’ views, such as we can piece them together, are
                  found in three passages.
                </p>
                <p>
                  First, there is a denial of Jesus as Christ, a denial that has
                  implications for their claim to know the Father
                  (2:22-23).&nbsp; The denial mentioned in these verses sounds
                  like it is simply a Jewish view like that of the Jewish
                  opponents in the Gospel.&nbsp; But something more subtle than
                  a bald denial of Jesus’ messiahship is involved, for if they
                  are explicitly denying that Jesus is the Christ why would
                  there be a need for John to write this letter to point out
                  their error?&nbsp; These opponents would not agree with John’s
                  charge against them; this is John’s interpretation of their
                  views.&nbsp; Further texts in 1 John reveal more about the
                  opponents’ views, and help us understand how John can see
                  their views as a denial that Jesus is the Christ.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Second, their denial concerns <em>Jesus</em> (4:2-3).&nbsp;
                  This passage is usually interpreted as referring to Docetism,
                  i.e., it is thought that the opponents are denying Jesus’
                  humanity.&nbsp; But nothing in 1 John clearly substantiates
                  this view.&nbsp; Turning to the text itself, there are two
                  ways to translate the key phrase in verse 2, Ἰησοῦν Χριστὸν ἐν
                  σαρκὶ ἐληλυθότα (<em>Iēsoun Christon en sarki elēluthota</em
                  >): “Jesus Christ has come in the flesh” or “Jesus is Christ
                  come in the flesh.”&nbsp; The clue to which of these is meant
                  comes in the next verse where it is said that this spirit does
                  not confess “Jesus” (v. 3).&nbsp; This suggests the second
                  translation is in view and that the emphasis is not on Jesus’
                  flesh (as in Docetism) but on the flesh of the Christ.&nbsp;
                  This notion is clarified by the third passage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Third, the opponents deny Christ’s death (5:6).&nbsp; Here we
                  have the most specific and the most cryptic information in the
                  letter on the christological issue.&nbsp; “This is the one who
                  came by water and blood—Jesus Christ; not by the water only
                  but by the water and the blood.”&nbsp; This text suggests that
                  some folk are affirming Jesus came by water, but not
                  blood.&nbsp; What might this refer to?&nbsp; One of the false
                  teachers that John had contact with according to Polycarp, as
                  reported by Eusebius (<em>Ecclesiastical History</em> 3.3.4;
                  cf. 3.28.6; 4.14.6), was Cerinthus.&nbsp; While not all of
                  Cerinthus’ ideas are combated in 1 John, one point in
                  particular may be in view here.&nbsp; For Cerinthus taught
                  (according to Irenaeus, <em>Against Heresies</em> 1.16.1;
                  3.2.1. and Epiphanius, <em>Refutation of Heresies</em> 28.1)
                  that messiahship came upon Jesus at His baptism and left Him
                  just before He died.&nbsp; Such a view could well be described
                  as coming by water but not by blood.&nbsp; The opponents could
                  even appeal to John’s Gospel to support such a view since the
                  Spirit comes upon Jesus at His baptism (John 1:32, 34), and
                  when He dies it says He “gave up the (or His) spirit”
                  (παρέδωκεν τὸ πνεῦμα<em>paredōken to pneuma</em>,
                  19:30).&nbsp; This text could easily be read, “He handed over
                  the Spirit,” and thus the Spirit left Him just as He died.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So the opponents would not deny that Jesus died but that Jesus
                  died as Messiah, thus denying that Jesus’ death mattered
                  theologically.&nbsp; “Gnostic theologians do not necessarily
                  <em>deny</em> that the events proclaimed of Jesus have
                  occurred in history.&nbsp; What they deny is that the
                  actuality of these events matters <em>theologically</em>.”<a
                    href="#_ftn9"
                    >[9]</a
                  >
                </p>
                <p>
                  So the basic Christological point in 1 John is the
                  <em>essential</em> identity of Jesus as the Messiah, the Son
                  of God, <em>especially</em> in His death.&nbsp; This set of
                  ideas is fundamental to all of John’s thought.&nbsp; For God
                  is love (1 John 4:8), and love is the laying down of one’s
                  life (1 John 3:16).&nbsp; So if Jesus did not die as Messiah,
                  the Son of God, then God has not been revealed.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                  We should note how difficult the situation was in which John
                  found himself.&nbsp; The opponents could use all the heaviest
                  language about Jesus, calling Him Son of God and accepting His
                  death.&nbsp; They only made what might appear to be one little
                  modification, but for John that little modification gutted the
                  gospel entirely.&nbsp; Their views do not simply represent a
                  few wrong ideas about the true God but rather they promote a
                  false god.&nbsp; This is why, as noted above, the letter ends,
                  “Little children, keep yourselves from idols” (5:21).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the Gospel the Cross is primarily seen as the revelation of
                  God’s glory, but the opponents’ views undercut this
                  revelation.&nbsp; Other views held by the opponents also deny
                  the atoning significance of the Cross.&nbsp; This atoning
                  aspect of the Cross is included in the Gospel, though only in
                  a few verses (for example, 1:29).&nbsp; John now emphasizes it
                  in his letter in order to correct the opponents’ wrong views
                  of sin, to which we now turn.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Christological points of dispute are fairly subtle and so
                  are the ethical issues.&nbsp; For John says the opponents are
                  claiming sinlessness while he himself at the same time speaks
                  of believers as being sinless.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                  To begin with, there is debate as to whether the opponents
                  were libertines or ascetics.<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;
                  Both views were held by different groups of Gnostics, since if
                  the material world is evil or inconsequential then either one
                  may say it does not matter what one does or one may try to
                  transcend the material through ascetical disciplines.&nbsp;
                  Such disciplines can look very much like Christian
                  asceticism.&nbsp; So, if these opponents were ascetics then
                  the situation confronting the Johannine community would have
                  been confusing indeed.&nbsp; The opponents could have looked
                  fairly righteous and thus their error all the more deceptive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The opponents’ claim to sinlessness seems to be in view in 1
                  John 1:8, 10.&nbsp; They are claiming a sinlessness apart from
                  God, Christ, and the atoning death.&nbsp; Not only did Messiah
                  not die, there was no need for Him to do so.&nbsp; This
                  sinlessness may have been very individualistic and elitist
                  since there seems to be a claim to know God in a way ordinary
                  Christians cannot (1 John 2:4-6; see also 2:15, 16; esp.
                  3:17-18).&nbsp; It has also been suggested that the opponents
                  held a Gnostic view of human nature as intrinsically divine,
                  having the divine spark,<a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a> though the
                  evidence for this specific view is less clear.<a
                    href="#_ftn12"
                    >[12]</a
                  >
                </p>
                <p>
                  So the basic characteristic of the opponents’ position is
                  autonomy.&nbsp; They experience both sinlessness and love
                  quite apart from Christ’s death and the Christian
                  community.&nbsp; In contrast, John’s view of sinlessness
                  emphasizes both the Son’s death and the community.&nbsp; John
                  affirms that sinlessness is indeed a goal (2:1-6), but he also
                  recognizes the need for forgiveness (2:1b, see also 1:9)
                  through Jesus’ death (1:7; 2:2).
                </p>
                <p>
                  According to John, Christians are to keep the commandments
                  (2:3-4, note the plural) and follow Jesus’ example
                  (2:6).&nbsp; The keynote is a life of love (2:7-11;
                  3:10).&nbsp; Love is the sign of the passage from death to
                  life (3:14) and this provides the key to an important, but
                  cryptic, passage regarding sin.&nbsp; In 1 John 5:16-17 we
                  hear of a “sin not unto death” (μὴ πρὸς θάνατον,
                  <em>mē pros thanaton</em>) and a “sin unto death” (πρὸς
                  θάνατον, <em>pros thanaton</em>).&nbsp; I think we find here
                  the communal aspect of John’s view of sinlessness.&nbsp; For
                  in the Church believers have passed from death to life, as we
                  have just seen.&nbsp; So the “sin unto death” would be the sin
                  of removal of oneself from the community which itself is the
                  realm of God’s life.&nbsp; John says we can pray for those
                  committing a “sin not unto” death and be assured of God giving
                  life because the one sinning is within the community of life
                  in which the blood of Christ cleanses from sin.&nbsp; But John
                  offers no such assurance for those committing the “sin unto
                  death” because they are rejecting the realm of life.&nbsp; He
                  does not say one cannot pray for such a person, only that
                  there is no assurance in their case.&nbsp; Thus the “sins not
                  unto death” are all sins that do not involve a removal of
                  oneself from Christ and His People, i.e., apostasy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The false sinlessness of 1 John 1:8, 10 is in striking
                  contrast to the sinlessness which John promotes (3:6,
                  9).&nbsp; In chapter 3 the one who is said to be born of God
                  and not sin is the one who loves “his brother” (3:10–18), that
                  is, who remains in the community which is the realm of Life
                  and Light and Love.&nbsp; Being part of this community,
                  however, does not mean they have no moral failings (1:8, 10),
                  even though they are to strive not to have such failings (2:1;
                  3:3).&nbsp; But it does mean that sin no longer characterizes
                  their life.&nbsp; That is, as the Reformers put it, those who
                  are in Christ are in a new situation, that of, “posse non
                  pecare,” (able not to sin) rather than their former condition
                  outside of Christ of, “non posse non pecare” (not able not to
                  sin).&nbsp; This idea seems to be the significance of the use
                  of the present tense in the verses that speak of believers’
                  sinlessness (3:6, 9; 5:18).&nbsp; Sin continues to be
                  committed and it is forgivable, but it is now the exception
                  rather than the rule—that is, while they may sin every day,
                  deeds in keeping with God’s will are the dominate
                  characteristic of their lives.&nbsp; This new life is only
                  possible because they are kept by Christ so that the Evil One
                  does not touch them (5:18).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The opponents have separated themselves from the community,
                  and this lack of love reveals their true character
                  (2:19).&nbsp; They did not share the abiding seed (3:9) almost
                  by definition since they would have abided.&nbsp; When John
                  says that not all are of us (2:19) he probably implies that
                  more defections are possible, which explains his concern in
                  writing (1:3; 5:13).
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, to summarize the teaching on ethics, John says that in
                  their departure from the Apostle and the community around him
                  the opponents commit the sin unto death by turning away from
                  the realm of life.&nbsp; The ethical argument is basically a
                  charge of lack of life.&nbsp; They have some form of obedience
                  to commandments, but in their lack of love they show
                  themselves strangers to the very heart of the
                  commandments.&nbsp; The commandments are characterized as an
                  <em>imitatio Christi</em> (2:6) and the chief quality of
                  Christ’ life was His revelation of God’s love.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The arguments regarding christology and ethics are
                  interwoven.&nbsp; The opponents neither confess Jesus as
                  Messiah Son nor follow Him in obedience.&nbsp; These are two
                  sides of a single coin in that they are both related to their
                  views of Christ’s death.&nbsp; The death of Jesus both reveals
                  God’s love and atones for sin.&nbsp; The opponents do not
                  believe they are in need of this atonement and they are also
                  unwilling to follow Jesus’ example by laying down their lives
                  for the brothers and sisters.&nbsp; So their belief and
                  behavior are inseparably intertwined.
                </p>
                <p>The Unity of Thought in 1 John</p>
                <p>
                  John’s thought is a &nbsp;Christocentric whole.&nbsp; Jesus is
                  the model of sinlessness in both of its senses, that is,
                  obedience to commands (2:3-6) and love (3:16-18;
                  4:9-10).&nbsp; Jesus’ death is the center of John’s thought,
                  and it is the very thing the opponents reject.&nbsp; John’s
                  thought in 1 John is not, as some have asserted, a
                  cut-and-dried confessional formula to which he has appended
                  some ethics.<a href="#_ftn13">[13]</a>&nbsp; Instead, it is
                  all interconnected.
                </p>
                <p>
                  His thought is fundamentally Theocentric.<a href="#_ftn14"
                    >[14]</a
                  >&nbsp; Behind the Christological whole is the ultimate ground
                  of John’s thought, God’s own nature.&nbsp; Behind the Son is
                  the Father.&nbsp; The whole of John’s thought can be seen to
                  center around two foci, two great theological affirmations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  First, God is Light (1:5).&nbsp; Light has many associations,
                  but in this context it is primarily related to ethics.&nbsp;
                  God is pure, holy, sinless, perfect.&nbsp; Jesus both reveals
                  God’s purity and provides the means by which believers are
                  able to share in that purity (3:5).&nbsp; The opponents in
                  their claim to sinlessness make God a liar (1:10) because He
                  claims to forgive us in Jesus, but this is wrong if we have no
                  need of forgiveness.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Second, God is Love (4:11-12).&nbsp; Love is the laying down
                  of one’s life and this is seen par excellence in the death of
                  the son (3:16-18; 4:9-10).&nbsp; This love is characteristic
                  of God’s very nature (4:11-12).&nbsp; Jesus did not empty
                  Himself despite being equal with God, but because of His
                  deity.<a href="#_ftn15">[15]</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                  God’s Light (holiness, sinlessness, perfection) and Love are
                  present in the community members and absent from the
                  opponents.&nbsp; This is to say, the one group shares in
                  divine Life and the other rejects it and departs into death.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thus, what is ultimately at issue in this letter is the truth
                  about God Himself.&nbsp; The opponents do not have a few
                  misunderstandings about the true God, as is often the case
                  with Paul’s readers.&nbsp; Rather, John believes, despite all
                  the wonderful affirmations about Jesus by the antichrists,
                  these folk have a different God, an idol (5:21).
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the two foci are God as Light and Love, the center of the
                  foci, as it were, is the theme of Life.&nbsp; All the major
                  aspects of John’s thought center around this motif.&nbsp;
                  Christology is connected to Life because to confess Jesus as
                  Son is to live in God (4:15), for Life is in the Son
                  (5:11-13)—indeed, Jesus <em>is</em> Life (1:1, 2; 5:20).&nbsp;
                  Ethics also is connected to Life since to obey the
                  commandments is to live in God (3:24) and to love is to live
                  in God (4:12, 16), so to love (3:14-15) and forgive (5:16) is
                  Life.<a href="#_ftn16">[16]</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thus, this letter presents us with a very profound revelation
                  of God in Christ and a challenging call to Life.&nbsp; As
                  such, it is a good example of what all theology should
                  be.&nbsp; Accordingly, I trust that this brief study is a
                  proper way to honor John Rodgers who is a good example in his
                  life, teaching, and leadership of what a theologian, educator,
                  and scholar bishop should be.

                  for the view that the author of 1 John was “less penetrating
                  and vigorous in mind … and much more limited in the range of
                  his thought” (19) than the author of the Gospel of John, and
                  that his attempts to adapt Johannine thought were “inept or
                  muddled” (20).

                  as for life and love (adjective instead of noun), but it
                  certainly adds to the theme I am developing.
